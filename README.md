# Data_Analytics
Learning Statistical Analysis, mostly in R

There is no finished project yet.
  One is in the works, a continuation of my Mathematical Research project of Fall 2017: Data Analytics in NFL/FFL.
  This will be my project for my current class: Data Analytics - Problem Solving in Business.

  Another is also in the works, some analysis of Global Warming on Instability data from my Modeling Project for the COMAP Competition.

So far, these are exercise labs from the book ISLR.
